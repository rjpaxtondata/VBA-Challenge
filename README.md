Purpose: The purpose of this assignment was to develop a VBA script capable of looping through multiple Excel worksheets and creating stock estimates (i.e., yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume) for multiple stock indicators across a three-year period (2014 - 2016).

Objectives:  The primary objective was to demonstrate intermediate VBA Coding skills by applying the following techniques
  1.  Nested For loops
  2.  Conditional formatting
  3.  If/Then statements
  4.  Within sheet macro buttons

Assignment instructions:  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  2.  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  3.  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
